# VS-haybales
This mod adds haybales for storing grass in larger quantities. Since these blocks are gravity influenced, a silo might be a good idea!

Compatability patches:
There is a folder that has a list of patches in this repo, im not sure if they can be integrated directly into the mod (I haven't looked into it much yet) but in that event it will be removed.
Otherwise, the patch in this folder can be moved into the assets\haybales\recipes\grid to replace the existing file there
